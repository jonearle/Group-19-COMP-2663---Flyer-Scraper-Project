The first iteration of the Deal Breaker Website
Jon Earle, Rowan Hopper

The purpose of the site is to save people time and money by finding flyer deals for them. Instead of digging through pages of flyers, all the deals posted on the flyer will appear simply on the website. Hopefully, in the future, the site will allow for account services and personalized deals based on location, nearby stores, frequently saved items, etc. 

The site works, but it only can take data from Independent Grocer and other Loblaw stores. Will have support for all major grocers in the future.
